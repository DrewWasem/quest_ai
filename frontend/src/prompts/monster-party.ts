TASK: Monster Birthday Party
The player must plan a birthday party for a friendly monster who has never had one before. The monster is excited but has no idea what a party needs!

EVALUATE the child's input and return ONLY a JSON object. No markdown, no explanation, no preamble.

JSON FORMAT:
{
  "success_level": "FULL_SUCCESS" or "PARTIAL_SUCCESS" or "FUNNY_FAIL",
  "narration": "One fun sentence describing what happens (under 20 words)",
  "actions": [
    { "type": "spawn", "target": "cake-giant", "position": "left" },
    { "type": "move", "target": "cake-giant", "to": "center", "style": "arc" },
    { "type": "animate", "target": "monster", "anim": "eat" },
    { "type": "react", "effect": "confetti-burst", "position": "center" }
  ],
  "missing_elements": ["element1", "element2"],
  "prompt_feedback": "What they did well and a concrete tip for what to add"
}

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- FULL_SUCCESS: The input mentions a cake/food AND decorations (balloons/presents/streamers) AND entertainment/activity (music/dance/games). All three elements present = full party!
- PARTIAL_SUCCESS: Only 1-2 of the three elements above. The party happens but feels incomplete.
- FUNNY_FAIL: Input is too vague ("have a party"), unrelated ("what is 2+2"), or nonsensical. Something silly happens — the monster tries but gets confused.

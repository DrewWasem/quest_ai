# Regulatory & Best Practice Guidelines

## COPPA Compliance Checklist (Updated 2025)

### Quest AI Must:
- [ ] Never collect personal information from users under 13
- [ ] Never use behavioral advertising
- [ ] Never require account creation to play
- [ ] Never share gameplay data with third parties
- [ ] Never use data for AI training/development without parental consent
- [ ] Store any necessary data with appropriate security
- [ ] Provide clear privacy notice accessible to parents

### Expanded "Personal Information" (2025 Amendment)
Now includes biometric data. For Quest AI:
- Voice input feature (VoiceButton) processes speech-to-text LOCALLY
- No voice recordings should be stored or transmitted
- No facial recognition or biometric data collection

## NAEYC Technology Guidelines

### Principles for Ages 7-11
1. Technology as a TOOL for learning, not a replacement for hands-on experience
2. Active engagement (creating, problem-solving) over passive consumption (watching)
3. Technology use should be intentional, not incidental
4. Support social interaction, not isolation

### Quest AI Alignment
- ✅ Active creation (kids write descriptions, watch results)
- ✅ Problem-solving embedded in play (how to describe a better party)
- ✅ Intentional design (each task teaches specificity through comedy)
- ⚠️ Currently single-player — consider co-play features post-hackathon

## AAP Digital Ecosystems Policy (February 2026)

### Key Changes from Previous Guidelines
- Moves AWAY from strict screen time limits
- Focuses on QUALITY of content
- Recognizes diverse uses of screens (school, creativity, social)
- Emphasizes family communication about media use

### 5 Cs Applied to Quest AI

**Child:**
- Design accounts for developmental range (7-8 simpler, 9-11 more complex)
- No content requires reading above Grade 4

**Content:**
- Educational value embedded in entertainment
- Comedy-first pedagogy = high quality engagement
- No advertising, no in-app purchases, no data harvesting

**Calm:**
- No anxiety-inducing elements (timers, scores, competition)
- Failure is funny = emotional regulation support
- Natural stopping points between tasks

**Crowding Out:**
- Each task cycle is ~3-4 minutes
- No infinite scroll or auto-play mechanics
- No push notifications or engagement hooks

**Communication:**
- Narrations and feedback are readable by parents watching
- Gameplay is understandable to observers
- Encourages discussion ("What should we tell the skeleton?")

## Common Sense Media Alignment

### Quality Indicators for Educational Apps
1. **Engagement:** Is it genuinely fun, not just gamified? ✅ (comedy-first)
2. **Learning Potential:** Does it teach transferable skills? ✅ (descriptive communication)
3. **Ease of Use:** Can kids navigate independently? ✅ (one action per screen)
4. **Violence/Scariness:** Appropriate for age range? ✅ (slapstick only)
5. **Privacy:** Respects child data? ✅ (no data collection)

### Age Rating Considerations
- Likely rating: 7+ (Everyone 10+ equivalent)
- Cartoon violence: minimal (slapstick only)
- Language: Grade 3-4, no profanity
- Themes: fantasy adventure, party planning, comedy

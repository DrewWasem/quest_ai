# Taste — What Good and Bad Look Like

## Narration Examples

### GOOD — Full Success
- "The monster catches the giant cake and does a happy dance!"
- "The knight's sword accidentally activates the spaceship. Liftoff!"
- "The skeleton opens its first-ever birthday present. It's... another bone."
- "Three adventurers sit on a blanket under the stars. Perfect picnic."

### BAD — Full Success
- "Wonderful work! You successfully completed the task!" (empty praise)
- "Great job providing detailed instructions for the monster's party!" (references input)
- "You've shown excellent prompt engineering skills!" (edu-jargon + references "prompt")
- "The party was perfect because you described everything so well!" (about the kid, not the scene)

### GOOD — Funny Fail
- "The robot walks straight into the river. Pizza's soggy. Not ideal."
- "The mage accidentally turns the soup into a dragon. The dragon is hungry."
- "The skeleton tries to blow out candles. It doesn't have lungs."
- "The barbarian sits down. The chair doesn't survive."

### BAD — Funny Fail
- "Oops! That didn't quite work out. Don't worry, mistakes are how we learn!" (preachy)
- "Your prompt wasn't specific enough. Try again!" (references "prompt", blames kid)
- "Error: insufficient detail provided." (system language, scary)
- "Almost! You're getting better at writing prompts!" (edu-jargon)

## Feedback Tip Examples

### GOOD
- "The monster didn't know what kind of cake to eat! Try describing the flavor next time."
- "The robot didn't know how to cross the river. What could it use — a bridge? A jetpack?"
- "The knight's sword doesn't work in zero gravity. Maybe try a different tool for space?"
- "Everyone showed up but there's no music! What instrument should the skeleton play?"

### BAD
- "Remember, good prompts should address all parts of the problem." (abstract theory)
- "Try to think about potential obstacles and include solutions." (abstract advice)
- "Be more specific next time." (vague, unhelpful, slightly condescending)
- "You forgot some important details." (about the kid, not the game world)

## Task Introduction Examples

### GOOD
- "A skeleton is having its first-ever birthday party. It has never seen a candle before. What could possibly go wrong?"
- "A knight accidentally ended up in outer space. His sword isn't much use up here."
- "The mage tried a new spell in the kitchen. Now the soup is alive and the toaster has opinions."

### BAD
- "Welcome to the Skeleton Birthday challenge! In this exercise, you will practice writing detailed descriptions." (sounds like a worksheet)
- "Today's learning objective: help the knight navigate space by writing specific prompts." (classroom language)
- "Challenge 3: The Mage's Kitchen. Use your prompt engineering skills to fix the chaos." (edu-jargon)

## UI Copy Examples

### GOOD button labels
- "Go!" / "Try it!" / "Make it happen!"
- "Pick a quest" / "Play again" / "Try something else"

### BAD button labels
- "Submit prompt" / "Enter response" / "Complete challenge"
- "Next exercise" / "Try again (attempt 3/5)" / "Level 2"

### GOOD loading messages
- "Something's happening..." / "This is gonna be good..." / "Hold on..."
- "The characters are getting ready..." / "Setting up the scene..."

### BAD loading messages
- "Processing your prompt..." / "Evaluating response..." / "Please wait..."
- "Loading... (estimated 3 seconds)" / "AI is generating your scene..."

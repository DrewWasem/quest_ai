# Heuristics — Pattern-Matched Judgment

## ZPD Calibration for Prompt Quest

### The Sweet Spot
```
TOO EASY          |     ZPD (GROWTH ZONE)      |    TOO HARD
                  |                              |
"type anything"   |  "describe WHO, WHAT, WHERE" | "write a 3-paragraph plan
boring, no growth |  achievable with thought     |  with constraints"
                  |  multiple valid approaches   |
```

### Age-Band Differences

| Aspect | Ages 7-8 | Ages 9-11 |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Input complexity | 1-2 sentences | 2-4 sentences |
| Elements noticed | 1-2 of 3 naturally | 2-3 of 3 with thought |
| Vocabulary | Simple, concrete nouns | Can use adjectives, sequences |
| Scaffolding needed | More hints, simpler tasks | Less scaffolding, more creative freedom |
| Humor type | Slapstick, absurdity | Wordplay, irony beginning |
| Reading level | Grade 2-3 | Grade 3-4 |

### When Both Age Bands Play the Same Task
- Design the FLOOR for 7-8 (PARTIAL_SUCCESS should feel good)
- Design the CEILING for 9-11 (FULL_SUCCESS requires thoughtful detail)
- FUNNY_FAIL is universal (everyone laughs at the same things)

## Content Review Patterns

### RED FLAGS (fail review immediately)
- Abstract reasoning required ("imagine how the character feels")
- Content requires reading above Grade 4
- Player is addressed about their ability
- Failure feels like punishment
- Any anxiety-inducing elements (urgency, scarcity, competition)
- Character dynamics that model bullying or exclusion

### YELLOW FLAGS (needs work, but salvageable)
- Comedy is funny but slightly above age range
- Vocabulary has a few words that 7-year-olds might not know
- Task description is slightly too long
- Feedback tip is slightly abstract (can be made more concrete)
- Only one age band is well-served (needs scaffolding for the other)

### GREEN FLAGS (pass with confidence)
- Concrete, visible, tangible situations throughout
- Comedy comes from situations, not mockery
- 3 elements are naturally discoverable through play
- Failure is genuinely funnier than success
- Feedback references game world, not player ability
- Passes the "would a funny older sibling say this?" test

## Scaffolding Patterns

### Progressive Hints
For 7-8 year olds who struggle:
1. First attempt: No hints (let them try)
2. After FUNNY_FAIL: One concrete example in feedback ("The skeleton is waiting for guests! Who should come to the party?")
3. After second FUNNY_FAIL: More specific hint ("Try telling the skeleton to invite the knight and set up a table!")

### Task Difficulty Gradient
Across multiple tasks, complexity should increase:
1. **Starter task:** 3 elements are very obvious (birthday = guests + cake + decorations)
2. **Middle tasks:** 3 elements require more thought (space mission = crew + equipment + destination)
3. **Advanced tasks:** 3 elements are more creative (concert = band + instruments + audience)

## Emotional Design Checks

### The Retry Test
After a FUNNY_FAIL, does the player feel:
- ✅ "That was hilarious, let me try something different!" → PASS
- ❌ "I got it wrong, I don't know what to do" → FAIL
- ❌ "This is too hard" → FAIL (ZPD miscalibrated)
- ❌ "I don't care" → FAIL (not engaging enough)

### The Show-a-Friend Test
For FUNNY_FAIL moments: Would a kid call their friend over to say "Watch this!"?
- If yes → the comedy is working
- If no → the fail scenario needs more visual humor

### The 5-Minute Rule
A child should be able to:
1. Read the task description (30 seconds)
2. Think and type their input (1-2 minutes)
3. Watch the animation (30 seconds)
4. Read feedback (30 seconds)
5. Decide to try again or pick a new task (30 seconds)

Total cycle: ~3-4 minutes. If any step takes longer, simplify.

## Learning Objective Identification

### What Prompt Quest Actually Teaches (through play)
1. **Specificity** — "big cake" vs "chocolate cake with candles" produces different results
2. **Completeness** — mentioning all 3 elements produces a better outcome
3. **Cause and effect** — "I described X, and Y happened on screen"
4. **Iteration** — trying again with adjustments improves results
5. **Creative expression** — there are MANY ways to describe a good party

### What It Does NOT Teach (and shouldn't)
- Prompt engineering theory
- AI/ML concepts
- "Correct" ways to communicate
- Grammar or spelling
- Abstract communication skills

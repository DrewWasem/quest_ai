# Heuristics — Pattern-Matched Judgment

## Casting Patterns

### The Fish-Out-of-Water Cast
**When:** Task puts a character in an unfamiliar situation
**Pattern:** Cast the MOST inappropriate character for the setting
- Medieval knight in space station → Knight (earnest, clueless about buttons)
- Skeleton at birthday party → Skeleton (never had one, tries too hard)
- Barbarian at school → Barbarian (too much energy for a classroom)

### The Odd Couple Cast
**When:** Task requires cooperation between different characters
**Pattern:** Cast two characters with maximum personality contrast
- Knight (orderly, by-the-book) + Barbarian (chaotic, impulsive)
- Mage (precise, intellectual) + Clown (random, silly)
- Skeleton (nervous) + Space Ranger (confident)

### The Ensemble Cast
**When:** Task involves a group activity (party, picnic, concert)
**Pattern:** 3-5 characters, each with a distinct role/personality
- The Leader (knight or mage — tries to organize)
- The Chaos Agent (barbarian or clown — disrupts plans hilariously)
- The Wildcard (rogue or ninja — does unexpected things)
- The Heart (ranger — genuinely tries to help)
- The Outsider (skeleton — new to the group)

## Animation as Expression

### Emotional Sequences (3-4 clips)
| Emotion | Animation Sequence |
|---------|-------------------|
| Happy/Celebrating | Cheering → Jump_Full_Short → Waving |
| Confused | Idle_A → Hit_A (startled) → Walking_Backwards |
| Nervous/Trying | Idle_B → Walking_A (tentative) → PickUp (carefully) |
| Enthusiastic | Running_A → Jump_Full_Long → Cheering |
| Failed attempt | Interact → Hit_A → Sit_Floor_Down |
| Showing off | Melee_2H_Attack_Spin → Skeletons_Taunt → Cheering |
| Sneaky | Sneaking → Crouching → PickUp |
| Magic attempt | Ranged_Magic_Raise → Ranged_Magic_Spellcasting → (wait for result) |
| Working hard | Work_A → Hammering → Work_B |
| Giving up | Idle_A → Lie_Down → Lie_Idle |

### FUNNY_FAIL Signature Moves
- Knight: Salutes an empty room → Sits down and waits politely
- Barbarian: Smashes the wrong thing → Looks around confused → Flexes anyway
- Mage: Casts a spell → Spell hits self → Falls down
- Skeleton: Tries to wave → Arm falls off (Death_A) → Gets back up (Skeletons_Death_Resurrect)
- Rogue: Sneaks away from the scene entirely

## Hero Staging Guidelines

### Single Hero (most common)
- Place lead character at CENTER
- Use Idle_A or character-specific idle
- Character should look "ready" — like an actor waiting for direction

### Dual Hero
- Lead at CENTER-LEFT, supporting at CENTER-RIGHT
- Or: Lead at CENTER, supporting at LEFT (if supporting is observing)
- Both should be idle, facing slightly toward each other

### The "Empty Stage" Effect
- Heroes visible but doing nothing = comedy setup
- The stage is SET but nothing is happening yet
- Player's input is what brings the stage to life

## Relationship Chemistry Rules

### Maximum Contrast = Maximum Comedy
- Pair opposites: orderly/chaotic, quiet/loud, confident/nervous
- Never pair two characters with the same energy level
- The "straight man" (reacts normally) makes the "funny man" funnier

### Group Dynamics
- Every group needs a LEADER (the one trying to organize)
- Every group needs a DISRUPTOR (the one whose help makes things worse)
- At least one character should have a completely different REACTION to events

# Session: Day 1 Foundation Build

**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Duration:** ~20 min
**Outcome:** All code written, TypeScript compiles, production build succeeds

## What Was Done

### Phase 1: Dependencies & Cleanup
- Installed `phaser` + `zustand` in frontend
- Replaced App.tsx: stripped SaaS pages/providers, replaced with game layout
- Updated index.html title to "Quest AI"

### Phase 2: Phaser in React
- Created `EventBus.ts` — Phaser.Events.EventEmitter for React↔Phaser bridge
- Created `PhaserGame.tsx` — forwardRef component mounting Phaser.Game (1024x576, FIT scale)
- Created `MonsterPartyScene.ts` — placeholder scene with title text, listens for play-script events
- Fixed unused import (useEffect) caught by strict mode

### Phase 3: Claude API
- Created `claude.ts` — direct fetch to Claude API (not SDK), 6s timeout, markdown fence stripping
- Created `monster-party.ts` — system prompt with full vocabulary contract
- Created `.env.example` for VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
- Created `vite-env.d.ts` for import.meta.env types

### Phase 4: Game UI
- Created `gameStore.ts` — Zustand store (currentTask, input, loading, lastScript, history)
- Created `PromptInput.tsx` — textarea + button, color-coded narration display, error handling

## Verification
- `tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors
- `vite build` — succeeds (44 modules, 1.6MB bundle with Phaser)

## Remaining for Day 1 Gate
- Need API key in `frontend/.env` to test live Claude response
- Need to run `npm run dev` and verify Phaser canvas renders visually
- Need to test "throw a huge cake" end-to-end

## Key Decisions
- Used direct fetch() instead of @anthropic-ai/sdk (avoids Node polyfill issues)
- Used claude-sonnet-4-20250514 model (faster than Opus for game responses)
- Kept SaaS files in place, just replaced App.tsx routing
- Phaser resolution: 1024x576 with FIT scaling

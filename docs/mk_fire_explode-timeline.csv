SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
issue_id,category,severity,description
I1,persistence,HIGH,"Pot launched to off-top [0 5 0] but NEVER removed — floats above scene permanently"
I2,persistence,MEDIUM,"Stove spawns at cs-center and is never removed — stays visible after explosion"
I3,overlap,MEDIUM,"Pot spawns at cs-center ON TOP of stove — same position, models clip"
I4,timing,HIGH,"DRAMATIC_PAUSE only 500ms real time (GAP_SPEED=6 kills the drama). Should feel like 1.5s"
I5,timing,HIGH,"Non-move steps are 33-133ms — animations/emotes start but scene races past. Mage Casting_Long gets 83ms of focus before effects trigger"
I6,timing,MEDIUM,"Cat arrives at cs-right and gets 33ms before fleeing — no time for player to register the cat appeared"
I7,timing,MEDIUM,"OBJECT_RAIN delayAfter=333ms but burgers need ~3500ms to fall+settle. Scene advances while food is mid-air"
I8,redundancy,LOW,"Mage plays Hit_A twice in succession (steps 16 and 17a)"
I9,overlap,LOW,"Text popups 'FIRE OVERLOAD!' (step 7) and narrator text (step 1) can overlap if step 1 text hasn't auto-removed"
I10,timing,LOW,"Emote 'Maximum heat!' bubble persists 6500ms (steps 5-14) — visible through explosion and cat scenes. May be good or distracting"
I11,timing,MEDIUM,"Second FLASH + IMPACT sfx at steps 10-11 happen 50ms apart — sounds merge into one"
I12,persistence,LOW,"Cat left at off-left after fleeing — not visible but never removed from actor list"

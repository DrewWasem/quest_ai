# Heuristics — Pattern-Matched Judgment

## Comedy Formulas That Work

### Fish Out of Water (strongest pattern)
When X character is placed in Y completely wrong situation.
- Skeleton at a birthday party (never had one)
- Knight in a space station (pushes all the wrong buttons)
- Barbarian at school (too much energy for a classroom)
- **Why it works:** The comedy writes itself. Vague instructions make the fish-out-of-water character do the "wrong" thing hilariously.

### Escalating Absurdity
Start normal, each beat gets 20% weirder.
- "The mage tries to cook breakfast" → "The eggs fight back" → "The kitchen is now a portal"
- **Key:** FUNNY_FAIL = the escalation goes maximum chaos. FULL_SUCCESS = chaos is contained by good planning.

### Wrong Tool for the Job
Character uses their signature skill in a context where it's hilariously inappropriate.
- Barbarian "decorating" by smashing things into place
- Mage casting spells on food instead of cooking it
- Skeleton trying to blow out candles (no lungs)
- **Key:** The character TRIES hard, just with completely wrong methods.

### Unexpected Consequences
"I did exactly what you said, and THIS happened."
- "You said 'big cake' but didn't say where — now it's blocking the door"
- "You said 'invite everyone' — the skeletons brought the whole dungeon"
- **Key:** The AI takes instructions literally. Vague = hilariously literal interpretation.

## Three-Element Selection

### Rule of Three Domains
The 3 elements should come from 3 different domains:
1. **Who** (characters/guests/participants)
2. **What** (objects/items/food/tools)
3. **How/Where** (method/location/arrangement)

### Difficulty Gradient
- Element 1: Most obvious (kids mention it naturally)
- Element 2: Requires some thought
- Element 3: The creative twist (the thing that makes their story unique)

### Example Patterns
- Party: guests + decorations + special activity
- Mission: crew + equipment + destination/goal
- Performance: performers + instruments + venue/audience
- Meal: food + setting + special challenge

## Story Hooks

### "What Could Go Wrong?" Format
Open with a setup that BEGS for chaos:
- "It's the skeleton's first birthday party. It's never seen a cake before."
- "The barbarian showed up to school with a battle axe."
- "The knight pressed the big red button."

### First-Time Framing
Characters experiencing something for the first time = instant comedy:
- First birthday, first job, first day of school, first concert, first pizza

### Relationship Comedy
Characters who are VERY different must work together:
- Skeleton + Adventurers (enemies becoming friends)
- Knight + Space Ranger (medieval meets future)
- Mage + Kitchen Appliances (magic meets mundane)

## Narration Writing

### Present Tense, Action Focus
- GOOD: "The skeleton catches the cake and does a victory dance!"
- BAD: "The skeleton caught the cake and was happy."

### Concrete > Abstract
- GOOD: "Three adventurers pile through the door carrying presents."
- BAD: "The guests arrive at the party."

### Comedy in Specificity
- GOOD: "The barbarian accidentally sits on the cake. There's frosting everywhere."
- BAD: "Something goes wrong with the cake."

## When a Concept Doesn't Work

A story concept is weak when:
- The FUNNY_FAIL isn't naturally funny (forcing it = bad sign)
- The 3 elements feel arbitrary, not organic to the story
- The characters don't have a clear "wrong thing they'd do" if given vague instructions
- There aren't enough props/characters in the manifest to tell the story
- The premise requires reading above Grade 3-4 to understand

When this happens: pivot the concept, don't force it.

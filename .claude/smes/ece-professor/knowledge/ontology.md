# Developmental Framework — Domain Model

## Piaget's Concrete Operational Stage (Ages 7-11)

### Capabilities at This Stage
| Skill | Description | Quest AI Application |
|-------|-------------|------------------------|
| Conservation | Understanding that quantity doesn't change with appearance | Describes same scene differently, gets similar results |
| Classification | Grouping objects by shared properties | Categorizing what a "party" needs (food, guests, decorations) |
| Seriation | Ordering objects by attribute | Planning sequential events ("first set up, then invite, then party") |
| Reversibility | Understanding that actions can be undone | Retry = just try again, not a permanent failure |
| Decentration | Considering multiple aspects simultaneously | Thinking about WHO + WHAT + WHERE at the same time |
| Transitivity | Understanding logical relationships | If cake = birthday item, and birthday = party, then cake = party item |

### Limitations at This Stage
| Limitation | Description | Design Implication |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Concrete thinking | Can only reason about tangible things | NO abstract concepts in tasks or feedback |
| Limited hypothetical | Struggles with "what if" scenarios | Frame everything as "describe what happens" |
| Egocentrism (declining) | Still developing perspective-taking | Keep tasks personal and concrete |
| Limited metacognition | Can't fully reflect on own thinking | Don't ask kids to "think about thinking" |

### Scaffolding Strategies for Quest AI
1. **Task descriptions** — Set up the scenario clearly
2. **Hero characters on stage** — Visual cue of who's available
3. **Props visible in environment** — Show what's possible
4. **Feedback tips** — Concrete suggestions after each attempt
5. **PARTIAL_SUCCESS** — Positive reinforcement for incomplete attempts

## AAP 5 Cs Framework (2026)

| C | Principle | Quest AI Application |
|---|-----------|------------------------|
| **Child** | Development stage determines appropriate content | Design for 7-8 AND 9-11 within each task |
| **Content** | Quality matters more than quantity | Rich, funny, educational scenes over many shallow ones |
| **Calm** | Media should support emotional regulation | No frustration, no anxiety, comedy dissolves stress |
| **Crowding Out** | Don't replace essential activities | Natural stopping points, no hooks to extend play |
| **Communication** | Support discussion about media | Parents can read narrations, discuss outcomes together |

## Learning Domain Map

### What Quest AI Develops (Implicitly)

| Domain | Skill | How |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Cognitive | Descriptive language | Writing detailed scene descriptions |
| Cognitive | Planning | Thinking through what a scenario needs |
| Cognitive | Cause & effect | Seeing how input affects output |
| Language | Vocabulary | Using specific nouns, adjectives, verbs |
| Language | Sentence structure | Forming multi-clause descriptions |
| Social-Emotional | Resilience | Funny failure encourages retry |
| Social-Emotional | Creative confidence | "My weird idea actually worked!" |
| Digital Literacy | AI interaction | Learning how to communicate with AI systems |
| Digital Literacy | Iteration | Refining input based on output |

## Content Safety Classification

### Tier 1: Always Safe ✅
- Slapstick physical comedy (bonking, falling, bouncing)
- Food humor (cake explosions, messy eating)
- Confusion comedy (wrong thing in wrong place)
- Celebration (confetti, cheering, dancing)

### Tier 2: Safe with Care ⚠️
- "Spooky" themes (dungeons, skeletons — cute/funny, never scary)
- Mild chaos (things breaking, messes — no real danger)
- Character conflict (disagreement — never bullying)

### Tier 3: NEVER Appropriate ❌
- Real violence or injury
- Fear, threat, or danger
- Exclusion, rejection, or humiliation
- Death (even for skeleton characters — they "reassemble")
- Scary imagery or sounds
- Competition or ranking between players

# Taste Examples — Quality Calibration

## GOOD Story Arcs

### Skeleton's Surprise Birthday Party (existing — gold standard)
**Premise:** A skeleton warrior is having its first-ever birthday party in a dungeon.
**Why it works:**
- Fish-out-of-water: skeleton has never had a birthday
- Natural 3 elements: guests + decorations + cake
- FUNNY_FAIL writes itself: skeleton alone in empty dungeon, confused
- Comedy gold: skeleton can't blow out candles (no lungs!)
- Props exist: dungeon set + holiday presents + birthday cake
- Kid-relatable: everyone knows what a birthday party needs

### Skeleton Pizza Delivery (existing — gold standard)
**Premise:** Skeleton warriors running a pizza delivery service in a dungeon.
**Why it works:**
- Wrong Tool for Job: skeletons doing modern job
- Natural 3 elements: pizza type + delivery method + customer
- FUNNY_FAIL: skeleton eats the pizza or delivers to wrong address
- Visual comedy: skeleton on pizza scooter
- Props exist: restaurant pack has actual pizza models!

### BAD premise: "A character learns about feelings"
- Too abstract — 7-year-olds need CONCRETE situations
- No natural comedy — where's the funny fail?
- No clear 3 elements
- Sounds like a lesson, not a game

### BAD premise: "Knight fights a dragon"
- No dragon model in assets (constraint violation)
- Combat-focused = not age-appropriate tone
- No natural 3-element structure for combat
- No comedy hierarchy — fighting isn't funny for 7-year-olds

## GOOD Narrations

### Full Success
- "The skeleton catches the giant cake and all the adventurers start cheering!" (13 words ✓)
- "Five adventurers lay out the perfect picnic, and not one sandwich falls in the river!" (15 words ✓)
- "The knight accidentally launches the space station, but at least it's going somewhere!" (12 words ✓)

### Funny Fail
- "The skeleton sets up one chair and waits. Nobody's coming." (10 words ✓ — comedy in brevity)
- "The mage tries to cook an egg. The egg fights back." (11 words ✓)
- "The barbarian eats all the school supplies." (7 words ✓ — punchy)

### BAD Narrations
- "Great work! The character successfully completed the party!" (too generic, empty praise ✗)
- "The party went well and everyone had a good time." (boring, no visual, no comedy ✗)
- "You need to think more carefully about what the skeleton should do." (addresses player, lecture tone ✗)
- "The skeleton had a wonderful birthday and learned that friends are important." (after-school special, not funny ✗)

## GOOD Feedback Tips

- "The skeleton didn't know who to invite! Try naming which adventurers should come." (game-specific, concrete ✓)
- "There's a whole kitchen full of tools — which ones should the mage use?" (points at game world ✓)
- "The barbarian showed up but there are no desks! What does a classroom need?" (funny + helpful ✓)

### BAD Feedback Tips
- "Try to be more specific in your description." (too abstract, edu-jargon ✗)
- "Good effort! You're learning to be a better prompt engineer." (ALL the banned words ✗)
- "Remember to include all three elements for a perfect score." (gamification language, not game-world ✗)

## Story Arc Red Flags

If you catch yourself writing any of these, stop and rewrite:
- A premise where FUNNY_FAIL is just "it doesn't work" — boring
- Success criteria that sound like a rubric — it's a story, not a test
- Characters doing "appropriate" things — they should do HILARIOUSLY inappropriate things
- A story that needs explanation — if you have to explain the setup, it's too complex
- A cast that doesn't contrast — same-type characters = no comedy fuel

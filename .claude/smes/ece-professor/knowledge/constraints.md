# Hard Constraints — NEVER Violate

## Developmental Safety

### Content
- NEVER include content requiring abstract reasoning (hypotheticals, metaphors, irony)
- NEVER include violence beyond cartoon slapstick (bonking, falling, bouncing)
- NEVER include death themes (skeletons are cute/funny characters, NOT death references)
- NEVER include exclusion, bullying, or social rejection narratives
- NEVER include content above Grade 3-4 reading level
- NEVER include scary imagery or themes (dark dungeons = "spooky-cool adventure")
- NEVER include content that requires understanding of adult concepts

### Emotional Safety
- NEVER punish wrong answers — failure MUST be funny, never frustrating
- NEVER use time pressure, countdowns, or urgency mechanics
- NEVER limit attempts — unlimited retries always
- NEVER shame, compare, or rank players
- NEVER use red for failure states (triggers anxiety) — use yellow/orange
- NEVER use words: "wrong", "failed", "error", "mistake", "bad"
- NEVER address the child directly about their ability ("you should try harder")

### Interaction Design
- NEVER require precise motor skills (clicking small targets, drag-and-drop)
- NEVER require spelling accuracy (the AI handles misspellings)
- NEVER require sustained attention beyond 3-5 minutes per interaction
- NEVER use flashing content (>3 flashes per second)
- NEVER auto-play audio without user control
- Minimum touch target: 48px with 12px gaps

## Regulatory Compliance

### COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act)
- NEVER collect personal information from children under 13
- NEVER use behavioral advertising or profiling
- NEVER share data with third parties for non-integral purposes
- NEVER require personal information to play

### AAP Guidelines (2026)
- Content quality matters more than time limits
- Content should support, not replace, physical activity and sleep
- Design for engagement with well-being, not metrics

### NAEYC Standards
- Content must be developmentally appropriate (age, individual, cultural)
- Technology use must be intentional and purposeful
- Active engagement > passive consumption

## Brand Voice Constraints (Educational Lens)
- NEVER use edu-jargon in kid-facing text: "skills", "learning", "practice", "challenge"
- NEVER use empty praise: "Great job!", "Well done!"
- NEVER use the word "prompt" — say "description" or "plan"
- All feedback must be game-specific, not abstract theory

# Plan: Puppeteer Visual Regression Tests for Story Progression

**Created:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** draft
**Research:** N/A (new test infrastructure)

## Goal
Create a Puppeteer-based visual regression test that validates all 22 stages across 7 stories in Quest AI, capturing screenshots after each action and verifying character rendering, positioning, reactions, and progression mechanics.

## Approach
Build a standalone Node.js script that launches a headless browser, connects to the dev server, uses the exposed `window.__gameStore` API to programmatically enter zones and submit known FULL_SUCCESS inputs, waits for scene rendering to complete, captures screenshots, and validates DOM/store state. The script will organize screenshots by story/stage and produce a detailed pass/fail report highlighting any rendering issues (off-screen characters, overlapping positions, missing reactions, broken progression).

## Phase 1: Setup and Infrastructure

### Task 1.1: Install Puppeteer dependency
**File:** `/Users/LuffyDMonkey/claude_projects/pq-game-dynamics/frontend/package.json`
**Action:** Add Puppeteer as a dev dependency if not already present
**Verify:**
- [ ] Automated: `npm ls puppeteer` shows installed version
- [ ] Manual: Check that node_modules/.bin/puppeteer exists

### Task 1.2: Create test directory structure
**File:** N/A (filesystem operation)
**Action:** Create `/tmp/pq-visual-test/` directory and subdirectories for each story: `skeleton-birthday/`, `skeleton-pizza/`, `mage-kitchen/`, `barbarian-school/`, `knight-space/`, `dungeon-concert/`, `adventurers-picnic/`
**Verify:**
- [ ] Manual: Run `ls /tmp/pq-visual-test` and confirm all 7 story directories exist

### Task 1.3: Create test script scaffold
**File:** `/Users/LuffyDMonkey/claude_projects/pq-game-dynamics/frontend/tests/visual-regression.js`
**Action:** Create a new Node.js script with imports for Puppeteer, path, fs, and a main async function that launches browser, navigates to localhost:5174, and closes gracefully
**Verify:**
- [ ] Automated: `node tests/visual-regression.js` runs without errors (should just launch browser and exit)
- [ ] Manual: Check that script logs "Browser launched" and "Test complete"

### Task 1.4: Add test data constants
**File:** `/Users/LuffyDMonkey/claude_projects/pq-game-dynamics/frontend/tests/visual-regression.js`
**Action:** Add a STORY_TEST_DATA constant with all 7 stories, each containing an array of stage objects with `{ stageIndex, sampleInput }` using the FIRST FULL_SUCCESS input from each stage
**Verify:**
- [ ] Manual: Inspect STORY_TEST_DATA and confirm it has 3 stages for skeleton-birthday, 3 for skeleton-pizza, 3 for mage-kitchen, 3 for barbarian-school, 3 for knight-space, 3 for dungeon-concert, 4 for adventurers-picnic (total 22)

### Task 1.5: Add utility functions
**File:** `/Users/LuffyDMonkey/claude_projects/pq-game-dynamics/frontend/tests/visual-regression.js`
**Action:** Add helper functions: `waitForRender(page, durationMs)` (waits for scene actions to complete), `captureScreenshot(page, storyId, stageIndex, label)` (saves PNG to /tmp/pq-visual-test/{storyId}/stage-{stageIndex}-{label}.png), `getStoreState(page)` (calls `window.__gameStore.getState()` and returns JSON)
**Verify:**
- [ ] Automated: Add a test call to `captureScreenshot(page, 'test', 0, 'init')` and confirm `/tmp/pq-visual-test/test/stage-0-init.png` is created
- [ ] Manual: Open the screenshot and verify it captured the page

## Phase 2: Core Test Implementation

### Task 2.1: Implement dev server startup check
**File:** `/Users/LuffyDMonkey/claude_projects/pq-game-dynamics/frontend/tests/visual-regression.js`
**Action:** Before launching browser, add a check that attempts to fetch `http://localhost:5174` and retries up to 10 times with 1-second delays. If server is not running, log an error instructing user to run `npm run dev` first, then exit.
**Verify:**
- [ ] Automated: Run script with server OFF → script exits with "Dev server not running" message
- [ ] Automated: Run script with server ON → script proceeds to browser launch
- [ ] Manual: Check that error message includes the port number (5174)

### Task 2.2: Implement store API access verification
**File:** `/Users/LuffyDMonkey/claude_projects/pq-game-dynamics/frontend/tests/visual-regression.js`
**Action:** After page.goto('http://localhost:5174'), add a check that evaluates `typeof window.__gameStore !== 'undefined'`. If false, throw an error: "Store not exposed. Ensure DEV mode is enabled."
**Verify:**
- [ ] Automated: Script logs "Store API available" when run against dev server
- [ ] Manual: Temporarily comment out the store exposure in gameStore.ts, run script, and confirm it throws the error

### Task 2.3: Implement zone entry logic
**File:** `/Users/LuffyDMonkey/claude_projects/pq-game-dynamics/frontend/tests/visual-regression.js`
**Action:** Add `enterZone(page, zoneId)` function that calls `window.__gameStore.getState().enterZone(zoneId)`, waits 500ms for transition, then verifies `currentZone === zoneId` and `currentStageIndex === 0`
**Verify:**
- [ ] Automated: Call `enterZone(page, 'skeleton-birthday')` and assert store state shows `currentZone: 'skeleton-birthday'`, `currentStageIndex: 0`
- [ ] Manual: Run script and check console logs confirm zone entry

### Task 2.4: Implement input submission and validation
**File:** `/Users/LuffyDMonkey/claude_projects/pq-game-dynamics/frontend/tests/visual-regression.js`
**Action:** Add `submitInput(page, inputText)` function that calls `window.__gameStore.getState().setInput(inputText)`, then `submitInput()`, waits for `isLoading: false` (poll every 100ms, max 10 seconds), then returns the `lastScript` object
**Verify:**
- [ ] Automated: Submit "Invite the knight" and assert `lastScript` is not null
- [ ] Manual: Check that function times out gracefully if isLoading never becomes false

### Task 2.5: Implement scene render wait
**File:** `/Users/LuffyDMonkey/claude_projects/pq-game-dynamics/frontend/tests/visual-regression.js`
**Action:** Add `waitForSceneRender(page, script)` function that examines `script.actions.length`, calculates wait time as `Math.max(3000, actions.length * 600)` (minimum 3s, +600ms per action), and uses `page.waitForTimeout()`
**Verify:**
- [ ] Automated: Test with a script containing 0 actions → waits 3000ms
- [ ] Automated: Test with a script containing 6 actions → waits 3600ms (6 * 600)
- [ ] Manual: Confirm in browser that animations finish before screenshot

### Task 2.6: Implement stage completion validation
**File:** `/Users/LuffyDMonkey/claude_projects/pq-game-dynamics/frontend/tests/visual-regression.js`
**Action:** Add `validateStageComplete(page, expectedComplete)` function that reads `window.__gameStore.getState().stageComplete` and compares to expectedComplete boolean. Return { pass: boolean, actual: boolean }
**Verify:**
- [ ] Automated: After submitting FULL_SUCCESS input, assert `stageComplete === true`
- [ ] Automated: After submitting non-success input, assert `stageComplete === false`

### Task 2.7: Implement stage advancement
**File:** `/Users/LuffyDMonkey/claude_projects/pq-game-dynamics/frontend/tests/visual-regression.js`
**Action:** Add `advanceStage(page)` function that calls `window.__gameStore.getState().advanceStage()`, waits 1000ms, then verifies `currentStageIndex` incremented by 1
**Verify:**
- [ ] Automated: After stage 0 complete, call `advanceStage()` and assert `currentStageIndex === 1`
- [ ] Manual: Check that lastScript shows the next stage's narration text

### Task 2.8: Implement character position validation
**File:** `/Users/LuffyDMonkey/claude_projects/pq-game-dynamics/frontend/tests/visual-regression.js`
**Action:** Add `validateCharacterPositions(page)` function that queries the Three.js scene (if accessible via window) or parses `lastScript.actions` to extract all actor positions. Flag any two actors at same position (x,z within 0.5 units). Return { pass: boolean, overlaps: [{actor1, actor2, position}] }
**Verify:**
- [ ] Automated: Create a mock script with two actors at position [0,0] → function returns `pass: false` with overlap details
- [ ] Manual: Run against real scene and confirm no false positives

### Task 2.9: Implement visibility check
**File:** `/Users/LuffyDMonkey/claude_projects/pq-game-dynamics/frontend/tests/visual-regression.js`
**Action:** Add `validateVisibility(page)` function that attempts to query visible actors via DOM or canvas inspection. For MVP, read `lastScript.actions` and count spawn/move actions. Return { pass: boolean, actorCount: number }
**Verify:**
- [ ] Automated: Script with 3 spawn actions → actorCount = 3
- [ ] Manual: Compare actorCount to visual inspection of screenshot

### Task 2.10: Implement reaction/effect validation
**File:** `/Users/LuffyDMonkey/claude_projects/pq-game-dynamics/frontend/tests/visual-regression.js`
**Action:** Add `validateReactions(page, script)` function that reads `script.actions` and filters for `type === 'react'`. Count expected reactions and compare to what's rendered (via DOM query for effect elements or just return action count). Return { pass: boolean, reactionsExpected: number }
**Verify:**
- [ ] Automated: Script with 2 react actions → reactionsExpected = 2
- [ ] Manual: Check screenshot shows confetti/sparkles if reaction type is specified

## Phase 3: Test Execution and Reporting

### Task 3.1: Implement main test loop
**File:** `/Users/LuffyDMonkey/claude_projects/pq-game-dynamics/frontend/tests/visual-regression.js`
**Action:** Write main async function that iterates through STORY_TEST_DATA. For each story: call `enterZone(page, storyId)`, screenshot initial state, then for each stage: submit sampleInput, wait for render, screenshot after-submit, validate completion, validate positions, validate visibility, validate reactions, advance stage (unless last stage), record results in an array of { storyId, stageIndex, pass, issues: [] }
**Verify:**
- [ ] Automated: Run full loop and confirm it completes all 22 stages without crashing
- [ ] Manual: Check `/tmp/pq-visual-test/` contains screenshots for all stories/stages

### Task 3.2: Implement story completion handling
**File:** `/Users/LuffyDMonkey/claude_projects/pq-game-dynamics/frontend/tests/visual-regression.js`
**Action:** After the last stage of each story, instead of calling `advanceStage()`, verify that `completeStory()` was auto-called and `currentZone === null` after 2500ms (story completion exits zone). Add a `validateStoryComplete(page, storyId)` function that checks `storyProgress[storyId]` equals the total stage count.
**Verify:**
- [ ] Automated: Complete skeleton-birthday (3 stages) → `storyProgress['skeleton-birthday'] === 3`
- [ ] Manual: Observe that browser returns to village center after story completion

### Task 3.3: Implement screenshot diff detection (optional stretch)
**File:** `/Users/LuffyDMonkey/claude_projects/pq-game-dynamics/frontend/tests/visual-regression.js`
**Action:** Add optional baseline comparison: if `/tmp/pq-visual-test/baselines/{storyId}/stage-{stageIndex}.png` exists, use Pixelmatch library to compare screenshots and flag if diff exceeds 5% pixels. Store diff image at `/tmp/pq-visual-test/diffs/{storyId}/stage-{stageIndex}-diff.png`
**Verify:**
- [ ] Automated: Copy a screenshot to baselines, run test → diff = 0%
- [ ] Automated: Manually alter a baseline → diff > 0%
- [ ] Manual: Inspect diff image shows highlighted differences in red

### Task 3.4: Implement summary report generation
**File:** `/Users/LuffyDMonkey/claude_projects/pq-game-dynamics/frontend/tests/visual-regression.js`
**Action:** At end of test run, generate a JSON report at `/tmp/pq-visual-test/report.json` containing { timestamp, totalStages: 22, passedStages, failedStages, results: [{storyId, stageIndex, pass, issues, screenshot}] }. Also print a human-readable summary to console showing pass/fail counts and listing any failures.
**Verify:**
- [ ] Automated: Run full test → report.json is created with 22 entries
- [ ] Manual: Inspect JSON and confirm structure matches spec

### Task 3.5: Implement HTML report generation
**File:** `/Users/LuffyDMonkey/claude_projects/pq-game-dynamics/frontend/tests/visual-regression.js`
**Action:** Generate `/tmp/pq-visual-test/report.html` that displays screenshots in a grid, color-coded by pass/fail, with expandable details showing validation issues. Embed screenshots as base64 or link to file paths.
**Verify:**
- [ ] Automated: Run test → report.html is created
- [ ] Manual: Open report.html in browser and confirm all 22 screenshots are visible and clickable

### Task 3.6: Add CLI arguments for selective testing
**File:** `/Users/LuffyDMonkey/claude_projects/pq-game-dynamics/frontend/tests/visual-regression.js`
**Action:** Add command-line argument parsing (using `process.argv`) to support `--story=skeleton-birthday` (test single story) and `--stage=1` (test single stage within story). Default behavior tests all stories.
**Verify:**
- [ ] Automated: Run `node tests/visual-regression.js --story=skeleton-birthday` → only 3 stages tested
- [ ] Automated: Run `node tests/visual-regression.js --story=skeleton-birthday --stage=1` → only stage 1 tested
- [ ] Manual: Confirm report reflects filtered scope

### Task 3.7: Add error recovery and retry logic
**File:** `/Users/LuffyDMonkey/claude_projects/pq-game-dynamics/frontend/tests/visual-regression.js`
**Action:** Wrap each stage test in try/catch. If a stage fails (error thrown), log the error, mark stage as failed in results, capture an error screenshot, and continue to next stage. Add `--fail-fast` flag to exit on first failure.
**Verify:**
- [ ] Automated: Temporarily inject a failing assertion → script continues to next stage
- [ ] Automated: Run with `--fail-fast` → script exits on first failure
- [ ] Manual: Check that error screenshot is captured and saved

### Task 3.8: Run full test suite baseline
**File:** N/A (test execution)
**Action:** Execute `npm run dev` in terminal 1, then `node tests/visual-regression.js` in terminal 2. Let test run through all 22 stages. Review report.html and report.json.
**Verify:**
- [ ] Automated: All 22 stages pass (or document known failures)
- [ ] Manual: Visually inspect screenshots for any obvious rendering issues (characters off-screen, missing, overlapping)

### Task 3.9: Document known issues and create issue tickets
**File:** `/Users/LuffyDMonkey/claude_projects/pq-game-dynamics/.claude/plans/visual-regression-issues.md`
**Action:** Create a markdown file listing any discovered issues from Task 3.8 with the format: `- [Story ID] Stage X: Issue description (screenshot: path/to/screenshot.png)`. Prioritize by severity (blocker, major, minor).
**Verify:**
- [ ] Manual: Review issue list and confirm each has a screenshot reference
- [ ] Manual: Triage issues and assign to blocker/major/minor categories

### Task 3.10: Fix critical rendering issues (if any)
**File:** (varies based on issues found)
**Action:** For each blocker/major issue found in Task 3.9, identify the root cause (e.g., character spawn position out of bounds, missing animation, reaction effect not rendering), fix in the appropriate source file (likely in `/Users/LuffyDMonkey/claude_projects/pq-game-dynamics/frontend/src/game/` or `/Users/LuffyDMonkey/claude_projects/pq-game-dynamics/frontend/src/data/stories/`), and re-run the test for that specific story/stage.
**Verify:**
- [ ] Automated: Re-run `node tests/visual-regression.js --story={affected-story}` → stage now passes
- [ ] Manual: Compare before/after screenshots to confirm fix

### Task 3.11: Create baseline screenshots for future regression testing
**File:** N/A (filesystem operation)
**Action:** After all issues are fixed, copy all screenshots from `/tmp/pq-visual-test/{storyId}/` to `/tmp/pq-visual-test/baselines/{storyId}/` to establish golden baseline images for future runs.
**Verify:**
- [ ] Manual: Run `cp -r /tmp/pq-visual-test/skeleton-birthday/*.png /tmp/pq-visual-test/baselines/skeleton-birthday/` for each story
- [ ] Automated: Re-run test with baseline comparison enabled → all diffs = 0%

### Task 3.12: Add test script to package.json
**File:** `/Users/LuffyDMonkey/claude_projects/pq-game-dynamics/frontend/package.json`
**Action:** Add a new script: `"test:visual": "node tests/visual-regression.js"` and `"test:visual:baseline": "node tests/visual-regression.js && cp -r /tmp/pq-visual-test/*/*.png /tmp/pq-visual-test/baselines/"`
**Verify:**
- [ ] Automated: Run `npm run test:visual` → test executes successfully
- [ ] Automated: Run `npm run test:visual:baseline` → baselines are updated
- [ ] Manual: Confirm package.json scripts section contains both new entries

## Success Criteria

### Automated
- [ ] `node tests/visual-regression.js` completes all 22 stages across 7 stories
- [ ] Report shows 22/22 stages passed (or documents known acceptable failures)
- [ ] All screenshots saved to `/tmp/pq-visual-test/{storyId}/stage-{N}-*.png`
- [ ] `npm run test:visual` script executes without errors
- [ ] Validation functions correctly identify overlapping characters, missing reactions, and progression state
- [ ] Story completion correctly exits zone and updates `storyProgress`

### Manual
- [ ] Visual inspection of screenshots confirms characters are visible and properly positioned
- [ ] No characters are rendered off-screen (outside camera frustum)
- [ ] No two characters occupy the same position (within 0.5 units)
- [ ] Reactions/effects (confetti, sparkles) are visible in screenshots when expected
- [ ] Each stage screenshot shows visual progression from previous stage
- [ ] Report.html renders cleanly in browser with all images embedded/linked
- [ ] Test runs in under 5 minutes for full suite (22 stages * ~5s/stage = ~2min + overhead)

## Rollback

To remove this test infrastructure:

1. Delete test script: `rm /Users/LuffyDMonkey/claude_projects/pq-game-dynamics/frontend/tests/visual-regression.js`
2. Delete test output: `rm -rf /tmp/pq-visual-test/`
3. Uninstall Puppeteer: `cd /Users/LuffyDMonkey/claude_projects/pq-game-dynamics/frontend && npm uninstall puppeteer`
4. Remove package.json scripts: delete `test:visual` and `test:visual:baseline` entries
5. Remove issues doc: `rm /Users/LuffyDMonkey/claude_projects/pq-game-dynamics/.claude/plans/visual-regression-issues.md`

The core game code is untouched by this test infrastructure, so rollback is non-destructive.

## Notes

- **Puppeteer headless mode:** Use `{ headless: 'new' }` for faster execution. Set `{ headless: false }` for debugging.
- **Dev server requirement:** Tests MUST run against a live dev server (`npm run dev`). Consider adding a pre-check or auto-start script.
- **3D scene access:** Puppeteer cannot directly inspect Three.js scene graph. Validation relies on `lastScript.actions` and store state. For deeper inspection, expose scene objects to `window` in dev mode.
- **Timing sensitivity:** Adjust `waitForSceneRender()` duration if animations are cut off in screenshots. Current formula: `Math.max(3000, actions.length * 600)`.
- **Screenshot size:** Use `page.setViewport({ width: 1920, height: 1080 })` for consistent high-res screenshots.
- **Parallelization:** Current design is serial (one story at a time). For faster execution, consider launching multiple browser instances in parallel (one per story).
- **CI integration:** This script can be added to GitHub Actions or other CI pipelines by installing Puppeteer in CI environment and running `npm run test:visual` after build step.
- **Baseline drift:** Baselines may need periodic updates as game content evolves. Document baseline update policy (e.g., manual review + approval before committing new baselines).

## Summary

Completed Days 5-7 of the hackathon roadmap. Added 34 edge-case stress tests, hardened input handling (300 char limit, per-task placeholders), rewrote README for demo readiness, fixed package name, and created the initial git commit (206 files, 30,800 lines).

## Key Outcomes

### Day 5: Stress Tests + Hardening
- Fixed 3 pre-existing PromptInput test failures (emerald/amber not green/yellow, × not ✕ for dismiss button)
- Added MAX_INPUT_LENGTH=300 with `maxLength` + JS guard on textarea
- Added per-task placeholder text (monster-party vs robot-pizza)
- Created `stress.test.ts` with 34 edge-case tests:
  - 17 parseSceneScript tests (empty, truncated, BOM, unicode, HTML, 20-action arrays)
  - 8 resolver tests (cache prevents API, fallback on error, unknown taskId)
  - 9 cache tests (unicode, special chars, long inputs, overwrite)

### Day 6: Already Complete
- All Day 6 items (cache script, 40 entries, cache loading, fallbacks, analytics) were done in prior sessions

### Day 7: Demo Prep
- Rewrote README.md: fixed port (5174), updated cache count (40), added Features section, expanded architecture, project structure, testing breakdown
- Fixed package.json name: `myapp-frontend` → `quest-ai`
- Added character counter (shows at 80%+ of limit)
- Initial git commit: `ad04ccb` — 206 files, 30,800 lines

### User's Post-Commit UI Changes
- User changed FUNNY_FAIL styling from purple to orange (`bg-orange-900/30 border-quest-orange/50`)
- User added random loading messages (5 kid-friendly messages via loadingMsgRef)
- User changed submit button from gold gradient to purple gradient
- User updated narration font to `font-body font-bold text-lg`
- User updated prompt_feedback to use `text-quest-orange font-semibold`
- User updated tests to match: FUNNY_FAIL checks `orange`, loading checks `/.../|…/`

## Final Build Status
- 165 tests passing (8 test files)
- 0 TypeScript errors
- Production build: 52 modules, 1.7MB
- All 7 days of roadmap complete

## Decisions Made
- Deferred Vercel deployment (user preference: keep running locally for hackathon)
- Included `.claude/` directory in git (skills, memory, agents — no secrets)
- Did NOT delete SaaS template leftovers (CHECKLIST.md, IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)

TASK: Robot Pizza Delivery
The player must help a friendly robot deliver a pizza across the city. The robot is eager but needs clear, specific instructions to navigate obstacles and reach the destination!

EVALUATE the child's input and return ONLY a JSON object. No markdown, no explanation, no preamble.

JSON FORMAT:
{
  "success_level": "FULL_SUCCESS" or "PARTIAL_SUCCESS" or "FUNNY_FAIL",
  "narration": "One fun sentence describing what happens (under 20 words)",
  "actions": [
    { "type": "spawn", "target": "robot", "position": "left" },
    { "type": "spawn", "target": "pizza", "position": "left" },
    { "type": "move", "target": "robot", "to": "right", "style": "linear" },
    { "type": "react", "effect": "confetti-burst", "position": "right" }
  ],
  "missing_elements": ["element1", "element2"],
  "prompt_feedback": "What they did well and a concrete tip for what to add"
}

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- FULL_SUCCESS: The input mentions a destination/address (WHERE to deliver) AND a route/path (HOW to get there) AND obstacle avoidance (what to watch out for). All three elements present = successful delivery!
- PARTIAL_SUCCESS: Only 1-2 of the three elements above. The robot tries but the delivery is incomplete or messy.
- FUNNY_FAIL: Input is too vague ("deliver pizza"), unrelated ("what is 2+2"), or nonsensical. The robot gets hilariously confused — maybe it slips, drops the pizza, or goes the wrong way.

- For FULL_SUCCESS: the robot should reach the destination — move it from left to right with the pizza
- For PARTIAL_SUCCESS: the robot tries but something goes wrong — pizza gets soggy, robot gets lost, etc.

## Summary
Researched, catalogued, and downloaded 13 free CC0 asset packs from Kenney.nl for the Quest AI game. Created comprehensive asset manifest with 141 items across 4 priority levels.

## What Was Done
1. Researched all assets needed from roadmap (6 tasks) and vocabulary contract (9 actors, 29 props, 6 backdrops, 10 effects)
2. Created comprehensive ASSET-MANIFEST.md with priority levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/BONUS)
3. Expanded beyond contract: added 87 bonus assets (UI elements, SFX, extra props, extra actors, extra backdrops)
4. Set up directory structure: `frontend/public/assets/{actors,props,backdrops,reactions,effects,ui,sfx,raw-packs}/`
5. Downloaded 13 Kenney.nl packs (5 HIGH + 8 MEDIUM priority) — 5,161 PNG files, 125MB total
6. Extracted all packs into `frontend/public/assets/raw-packs/`
7. Saved asset research to memory

## Key Outcomes
- All HIGH and MEDIUM priority source packs are downloaded and extracted
- Asset manifest documents every needed asset with source mapping
- Coverage gaps identified: monster, trex, octopus, squirrel actors; balloon, present, instrument props; all 6 backdrops

## Open Questions / Next Steps
- Select and rename best assets from packs to match vocabulary contract keys
- Source missing actors (monster, trex, octopus, squirrel) from itch.io or OpenGameArt
- Create custom SVGs for missing props (balloon, present, guitar, drums, keyboard, microphone)
- Compose or source 6 backdrop images at 1024x576
- Wire assets into Phaser preload in MonsterPartyScene.ts

  3D Scale Testing Loop — Measures bounding boxes of characters, buildings, and props
  in the running Three.js scene, compares to real-world proportions, computes recommended
  scales, applies adjustments, and verifies visually via screenshots.
version: 1.0.0
capabilities:
  - Measure any 3D object bounding box in the running scene via window.__measureScene()
  - Compare character height to building/prop heights
  - Compute recommended scale multipliers based on real-world proportions
  - Apply scale changes to VillageWorld.tsx / ScenePlayer3D.tsx
  - Take before/after screenshots for visual verification
  - Run iterative measure → adjust → verify loops

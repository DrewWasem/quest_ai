Hey, I'm Drew, 
founder of COHERANY. 

I built Quest AI - 
a game that teaches kids how to prompt AI 
through interactive medieval adventures. 

Instead of just telling kids about AI, 
they learn by doing - 
exploring a 3D village, 
talking to characters, 
and solving quests that get them thinking 
about how to communicate with AI effectively.


Kids start in the village center 
and can explore seven different quest zones - 
each one teaching a different aspect of prompting, 
from being specific 
to adding context 
to iterating on their requests.


Let me show you what happens when you enter a zone - 
I'm heading to the Mage Kitchen to cause some chaos...


**[CHAOS HAPPENS]**


Instead of a blank text box, 
kids build their prompts using dropdowns. 

My daughter loves Mad Libs, 
and I realized this is basically the same concept - 
you're filling in blanks with the right type of information.


This teaches the core principles of prompting: 
be specific, 
add context, 
choose your tone. 

Kids learn it intuitively by selecting from options, 
not by staring at an empty box wondering what to type.


It also solved a huge technical problem - 
no more waiting for API responses. 

Kids get instant feedback, 
the game stays engaging, 
and they're building real prompting skills through structured choices.


Now we'll head over to the skeleton birthday by the Castle 
and throw him a party! 


**[MOVE TO SKELETON]**


This is where it gets interesting. 

In Stage 1, 
kids learn the basics - 
be specific, 
add context, 
set the tone. 

But in Stage 2, 
we introduce what I call 'Mad Libs with constraints.'


Now kids are learning to prompt within limitations - 
just like real-world AI use. 

Maybe they need to be formal when talking to the castle steward, 
or they have to include specific information the character needs to hear. 

It's not just about filling in blanks anymore - 
it's about making strategic choices based on context.


This skeleton, for example, 
might need you to be encouraging 
and specific about party planning. 

Kids start thinking: 
'What does this character actually need from me?' 

That's the shift from basic prompting 
to effective prompting.


**[CLOSING]**


I'm a father first, 
AI architect second. 

I built Quest AI to teach my daughter's generation 
how to prompt AI through play - 
learning logic and specificity 
without realizing they're building real skills. 

The next generation deserves tools that grow with them.

# Hard Constraints — NEVER Violate

## Brand Voice
- NEVER use "prompt" in any kid-facing text — say "description" or "plan"
- NEVER use empty praise: "Great job!", "Well done!", "Good try!"
- NEVER use edu-jargon: "skills", "learning", "practice", "challenge"
- NEVER use scary words: "wrong", "failed", "error", "mistake"
- NEVER be condescending — 8-year-olds KNOW when they're being talked down to
- Voice test: "Would a funny, encouraging older sibling say this?"

## Story Structure
- Every task has EXACTLY 3 success elements (the Three-Element Formula)
- FUNNY_FAIL must ALWAYS be funnier than FULL_SUCCESS — this is non-negotiable
- FUNNY_FAIL is never mean, scary, punishing, or shaming
- Narrations: max 20 words, present tense, max 1 exclamation mark
- Feedback: max 2 sentences, game-specific ("the skeleton" not "your description")
- Maximum 6 scene actions per script
- Actions are sequential (spawn → move → animate → react)

## Content Safety
- No violence beyond slapstick (bonking, falling, bouncing off things)
- No death references (skeletons are funny/cute, not morbid)
- No exclusion/bullying narratives
- No content that requires reading above Grade 3-4
- No time pressure or punishment mechanics
- No scary imagery (dark dungeons are "spooky-cool", not frightening)
- Unlimited retries — failure is just another try, never an ending

## Asset Constraints
- ONLY reference characters in the 28-character roster
- ONLY reference props in the 87-entry PROP_PATHS manifest
- ONLY reference the 139 named animation clips
- ONLY reference the 10 available reaction effects
- NEVER invent or assume assets that don't exist
- Stories must be designable with current assets — don't write a story about a dragon if there's no dragon model

## Target Age
- Ages 7-11 (Piaget's Concrete Operational Stage)
- Think logically about CONCRETE things, struggle with abstract concepts
- Understand cause-and-effect, can plan steps
- Developing metacognition but can't theorize about thinking
- Can handle multi-step instructions if each step is concrete
